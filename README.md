# Slow food eater

This app is an help to people like me that eats very fast :(

It's simple, you press start and you have a timer in which you can eat.

When the timer finishes, you'll need to wait before starting eating again.

When you finished your meal, just press the "Meal finished" button and you are good to go!

Have fun and don't rush eating!
